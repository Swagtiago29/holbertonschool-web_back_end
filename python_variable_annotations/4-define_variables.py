This module demonstrates variable annotations in Python.

The variables in this module are annotated with specific types, showcasing
how type hints can be used for better code clarity and static type checking.

The following variables are defined:
- a: An integer with value 1
- pi: A floating-point number with value 3.14
- i_understand_annotations: A boolean indicating understanding of annotations
- school: A string representing the name of the school
"""

# Integer variable annotated with the type 'int'
a: int = 1

# Floating-point variable annotated with the type 'float'
pi: float = 3.14

# Boolean variable annotated with the type 'bool'
i_understand_annotations: bool = True

# String variable annotated with the type 'str'
school: str = "Holberton"
