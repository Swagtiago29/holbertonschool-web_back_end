"""
This module provides a function to sum the elements of a list.

The `sum_list` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum
of those numbers as a floating-point value. Each element of the list is
assumed to be a number that can be added together.

Note: The code has a small issue with variable initialization, which is
explained in the comments below.

    """
    Sum the elements of a list and return the result as a float.

    This function iterates through each element in the provided list and
    adds them together. The sum is returned as a floating-point number.

    Parameters:
    input_list (list): A list of numbers to be summed. The numbers in
                       the list are assumed to be of type int or float.

    Returns:
    float: The sum of all the numbers in the list.

    Example:
    >>> sum_list([1, 2, 3])
    6.0

    for i in input_list:
